# KalleBot
my very simple discord bot project, Kalle!
you can use it, even work with me if you want to just call me on discord the nick is `kaalwy_`!

## how do i use Kalle?
i have a website project in my github profile for the bot so you can invite him to discord, all you need to do to copy the functionalites i already created is to create .env file in your project you can install it by the simple command `pip install dotenv`.

## addictional dependencies
- `pip install discord.py`
- `pip install commands`
- `pip install async-timeout`
